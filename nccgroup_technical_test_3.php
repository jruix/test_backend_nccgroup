 * To make the code production-ready
 * - I'll run a code sniffier (phpcs) if not already used as plugin in the IDE to ensure the code is following code standars
 * - Create a some unit tests using phpunit for instance to ensure that future changes won't modify the desired behaviour of the code
 * - Create some functional test if possible using behat for instance
 * - Send the code to another developer for code review if it's include in the code flow of the team.
